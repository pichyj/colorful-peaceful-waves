# What does this scene represent?
This scene represents a living diorama of a peaceful ocean wave washing onto the sandy shore. Waves are 
not still due to the moon's push and pull, therefore this project depicts the waves 
moving on their own. When you move left and right, you will see some creatures on 
the sand and a message about the waves.

# What inspired this image?
Ocean waves washing onto the sand allowed me to be inspired and in a way recreate it.
It also was a reference to the colors that were chosen. Here is the image:

# What makes certain objects special?
I first inputted seventeen hex color codes that depict the color of the ocean. After
creating the colors, in order to make the waves known to audiences, I made sure that 
the width, height, x, y, and z the same but added more numbers so that the waves were 
not in a straight line as an ocean moves. Additionally, when you right click, there is
an additional wave above to form more waves coming onto shore. The shift property
allows for different variations of each rectangle that corresponds to a color to be thinner or thicker and this helps out
with waves in order for not everything to be the exact same size.
